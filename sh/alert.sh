# Discord alerting for nightly and release failures, after moq-dev/moq's.
# Usage:
#   sh/alert.sh discord   Post the current workflow_run failure to Discord.
#   sh/alert.sh check     Verify alert.yml watches every alertable workflow.
#
# Environment (discord):
#   DISCORD_WEBHOOK   Required. The #alerts channel webhook URL.
#   RUN_REPO          Repository, since the channel is shared.
#   RUN_NAME          Workflow name (github.event.workflow_run.name).
#   RUN_URL           Run html_url.
#   RUN_CONCLUSION    failure / timed_out.
#   RUN_EVENT         What triggered the failed run (schedule, push, ...).
#   RUN_REF           head_branch.
#   RUN_TITLE         display_title, usually the commit subject.
#   RUN_ACTOR         Triggering actor login.
